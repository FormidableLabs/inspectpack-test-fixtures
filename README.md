Inspectpack Test Fixtures
=========================

Packaged, ready-to-go fixtures for test scenarios that won't blow up our git size.

## Fixtures

Our basic directories:

* `src`: Source code that we build to `dist`.
* `built`: Pre-built, manually tweaked bundles.

* `src/bad-bundle.js` -> `dist/bad-bundle.js`
* `built/basic-lodash-object-expression.js`
